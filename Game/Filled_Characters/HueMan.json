		"1": "My ideal holiday is going to the beach with my children. They're 4 and 6. Little Annie just started school but she is finding it hard to adjust so I keep her home some days, I'm fortunate that I can wfh once a week, which some people find surprising, what with me being a bank teller, but Annie is waiting on her ADHD diagrosis at the moment and Sid has football training three days a week so I have a valid requirement to stay home in accordance with the 2010 Protected Characteristics Act since Sid is trying out for the district squad as a defender, he prefers midfield and we've been working on his positional awareness on the wing but the competition for a place in defence is lower and we are trying to live by SMART goals, Simple Manageable Achievable Repeatable Tangible, so as to keep our progress aligned with our self-actualisation mission.",
		"2": "I had a spare few hours last Wednesday, Sid having just been dropped at lacrosse, since his panic attack at the district football trials, well I thought, I haven't droped a penny at the local multiplex in a few, I wonder what is playing, a few oddball comedies, a Wes Anderson but, I don't really 'get' him, don't get me wrong, I like the look of his film but everyone just talks so strangely, why not just write dialogue that makes sense, so I opted for the safe bet, and as a Marvel completionist it was, in hindsight, the only choice, with Paul Rudd in a starring role I just can't say no, he is the everyman, yet also unachievably desirable, I just don't know how he does it, the looks, the charm, the comedic timing, he scaled down to the size of an ant, anyone else I wouldn't have bought it, but Paul, he can sell a quantum effect, and he researches his roles, that's what makes it so believable, you know he knows what he's talking about, because he's read the current research, he has studied Pimm particle as any truly professional actor would.",
		"3": "So, you'll get a kick out of THIS, you sicko, with Sid coming home from the old slammer, with a yarn to spin, spinning like the kick he received from old Billy no mates in class, Calum Geates, jealous, no doubt, of young Sid's popularity since making distric lacrosse, and feeling low since his mullet was ruined by the local scissor-smith, it is the laughing stock of the playground, or so I here, not an ounce of Sid's fault, he bears the full brunt of Calum's anger, sticks stones and all, and what help does he get, any sympathy from those in whose care he supposedly lies, no, a 'reconciliatory conference' with his abuser before being forced to accept a transparently lacking apology, almost casting the asailant as the victim, what irony, what twisted irony in a storming sea of mediocrity and conformism... I told Sid to hit him, hard.",
		"4": "Saw the kids again last Saturday, oh how Annie's grown, she's wearing earrings now, I don't even know if they're pierced or clip on, or magnetic, is that a thing, surely must be, Sid would know, he's really taken to his science in his new school since they kicked him out of Ocean Academy, he says this one really is the Slammer, and after the incident with Geades, he really took to asserting himself, and it faired well, his lacrosse form was fine, until that wimpy little Anderson boy made such a hooha over his nose, any decent lacrosse player has a bent nozzer and recieving it before the game is even more a mark of quality, quality lacking from his excellent royal honour who twisted my words and lost me the right to see my darlings, and now without the kids even the bank is after me, saying I don't have any reason to wfh now, when as an estranged father I need even more time for travel to visit, visit the little darlings, oh how I miss them, everyday I miss them, not their mother, or steve, steve, who once I hath thought a friend, steve sitting with the children at the dinner table each night, laughing with their little stories they tell about their silly little days, daddy steve read me a story, tuck me into bed, I love you steve, steve...",
		"5": "How's your morning going? Mines being a bit of a Debby-Downer, first I was awoken at 5.30 AM by my neighbor mowing the lawn, he's angry because his Amazon delivery got sent to my house last week and everyone in the neighborhood knows that if they don't collect their post from me, when this happens, I will use it as fuel for my weekly bonfires, they used to be monthly but since that whore left me I've been finding a lot of my items remind me of her lying cheating flabby flat ass, and so you see they became more frequient, it was a slow build up but, if you knew her you'd understand, anyway where was I? oh yes, so the neighbor's taken upon themselves to try and get under my skin, a few days ago he attempted to grind my gears by theatening to get the police involved, he turned red in the face like a chump and bouncing angrily up and down, but I have a sign clearly indicating my actions in such a situation, which my friend, who studied law, so he's a really clever chap, he's spent time in jail so he know the legal system inside and out, he's got both street smarts and bok smarts, just like me, we are the Alphas of this world, but unfortunately, due to the contraceptive pill, women are too hysterical to see that, you see before women took the pill, in their natural state so to speak, they crave the touch and smell of a strojng Alpha man to protect them, it's Survival of the fittest you see, and women are too weak to survive on their own, and after I got through my morning, with QUITE a large coffee I may say, my ex texts me to say that Steve's taking the kids to Disney this weekend, but this weekend is my weekend, and so I texted right back disallowing this course of events, but she sends me back some bull that, just because I left Sid in the icecream section in the supermarket for a few hours, they need to make it up to the kids with a treat, and she made some snide remarks about responcibility or something, but I am a manager, I am responcible for no less than 3 underlings, if that's not recponcible, I don't know what it, and then, you would not believe what happend, as soon as I got into work I get an email from HR about an emergancy meeting, so I go and turns out the intern has been telling lies about me, they told HR that I've been making 'inappropriate comments' about their appeance when I was only complementing them, so I got a bollocking and now I'm on some kind of watch list."
